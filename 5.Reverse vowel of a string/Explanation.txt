In this problem we have to reverse only vowels maintaining the repective position of consonants constant.
We will traverse the array from beginning, if we found any vowel we start traversing our array from end. If
we found any vowel again then we swap their respective positions.
We will use index i traverse forward and index j to traverse backward.
we will iterate until i<j;
Example :- Input: s = "leetcode"
initialise i=0; j=s.length()-1=7;
i=0; ch=l;  //It is consonant continue;
i=1; ch=e;  //It is vowel start iterating j from end;
{   
    j=7;  ch1=e;  //It is vowel;
    Interchange the position of ch and ch1;
    s="leetcode";
 }
Currently i=2; j=6;
start iterating i again:
i=2;  ch=e;  //It is vowel start iterating j ;
{
   j=6; ch1=d;  //It is consonant  continue;
   j=5; ch1=o;  //It is vowel;
   Interchange ch and ch1;
   s="leotcede";
}
Currently i=3; j=4;
start iterating i again:
i=3;  ch=t;  //It is consonant  continue;
i=4;
since  i=4  and j=4   so condition i<j becomes false and our loop terminates
Final  s="leotcede";
