Here, We have to print the characters of the Word1 and Word2 alternatively. We will take a variable pos to point at the current index and print the character at that index.
For example:- word1="abc"   word2="pqr" 
initialise pos=0;   str=""  //To  store the result
First iteration: pos=0   str="ap"
Second iteration: pos=1   str="apbq"
Third iteration: pos=2    str="apbqcr"

If in case one string is larger than the other then we concat the remaining character of the larger string to str.
For example:-  word1= "ab"   word2="pqrs"
initialise pos=0;   str=""  //To  store the result
First iteration: pos=0   str="ap"
Second iteration: pos=1   str="apbq"
remaining character of word2 are:  "rs"
str="apbqrs"
