#Approach:1
Suppose there are two Strings:  str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
there length are n1=6,n2=3;
We will call the helper function as (str1,str2) as n1>n2.
We will initialise idx as str2.length() idx=3
Now we will check if length of both the strings are completely divided by idx.
str1:6%3=0 (true)
str2:3%3=0 (true)   //We will continue the loop.
Firstly we will check for str1 that whether str1 can be formed by repetition of substring.
substring is taken as str2.substring(0,idx) i.e, "ABC"
First iteration:
str1.substring(0,3) = "ABC" ; //true
Second iteration:
str1.substring(3,6)= "ABC"; //true
For str2:
First iteration:
str2.substring(0,3)= "ABC"; //true
Since str1 and str2 matches with "ABC", we will return "ABC"


#Approach:2
In this Approach we will concanate str1+str2  and str2+str1  if both are not equal return "".
after concanating "ABCABCABC"=="ABCABCABC" both are equal
we get gcd of n1 and n2 and return str1.substring(0,gcdLength)
